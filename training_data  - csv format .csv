Since Bactiguard is a small company with around 40 employees, I have been fortunate to be involved in most aspects related to the company's finances, analysis, and digital development. For example, a colleague and I created an internal sales report from scratch, which now provides weekly sales statistics from around the world.

The key has been creating dynamic reports and actively listening to user feedback. I have also independently carried out data retrieval and analysis for several business cases and business decisions presented to the board. Among other things, I conducted profitability and scenario analyses that formed the basis for the decision to discontinue two of our product areas, which has subsequently saved the company millions and allowed us to focus more on our core business. I am confident that I can help Awardit achieve its goals and bring additional transparency and efficiency to the financial processes. I look forward to hearing from you!"
